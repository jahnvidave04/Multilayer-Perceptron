# Multilayer-Perceptron

Implement backpropagation algorithm and train multi-layer perceptron to distinguish between 4 classes. 

Provided two files "train data.csv" and "train labels.csv".

Dataset contains 24754 samples each with 784 features divided into 4 classes(0,1,2,3).

One input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer in implementation. Labels are one hot encoded. Provide one single function that allows to use the network to predict the test set. This function should output the labels one-hot encoded in a numpy array.
